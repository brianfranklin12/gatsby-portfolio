title: "What I Plan on Learning Next"

Today I passed my final project review for Flatiron school. I have so many emotions right now, it’s hard to process what I’m feeling. I’m extremely proud of myself for powering through the curriculum while balancing a full time job, and helping raise two kids with my wife. Now, it’s time to shift gears and put my energy towards finding my first developer job. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t terrified. I know the tech industry is tough to break into and landing that first job can be challenging.

Mostly though, I’m excited to keep learning. If there’s one thing that I was reminded of during my time working through the curriculum at Flatiron, it’s how much I love learning new things. I don’t want to stop picking up new skills and learning new languages / technologies. It’s honestly overwhelming trying to pick what to focus on next. The nice thing about going through a program like Flatiron, is that the curriculum is guided. Now, I’ve got to make decisions on what I want to focus on and I think I’ve decided where I’d like to start.

I really loved working in React, and want to keep exploring that world, so I’m going to start learning React Native! I’m hoping the learning curve won’t be too steep. Once I build out a couple really small projects (a todo list application / maybe an instagram style clone), I want to try to build a full stack native application, using Express for the back end. I feel pretty comfortable building JSON apis with Rails now and want to challenge myself to learn a different backend framework.

There’s so much more I want to learn (GraphQL, MongoDB, Svelte, AWS, etc) but I think that’s a good place to start. Between applying for job, practicing data structures & algorithms, and learning these new skills, I think I will keep myself plenty busy. I’ll continue to post about my experiences with these new technologies, and maybe post content about the job hunt process as well. It’s an exciting new chapter of my software engineering journey and I cannot wait to get started.
